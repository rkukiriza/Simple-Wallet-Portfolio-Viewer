Simple Wallet Portfolio Viewer

Overview

The Simple Wallet Portfolio Viewer is a Python-based tool designed to visualize a cryptocurrency or financial asset portfolio through an intuitive pie chart. It aggregates asset holdings, calculates their total value, and displays the portfolio distribution, grouping smaller assets into an "Other" category for clarity. This project is ideal for users who want a quick and visually appealing way to analyze their portfolio allocation.

Dynamic Pie Chart: Generates a customizable pie chart with percentage labels for significant slices (>2%), a legend, and a total portfolio value in the title.
Save Functionality: Saves the pie chart as a high-resolution PNG file for sharing or reporting.
Error Handling: Includes data validation to ensure numeric values and prevent plotting issues.

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
